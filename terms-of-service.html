        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing or using the PrimeLocalLead website (“Website”), which is
          owned and / or operated by Woodpecker Services LLC, you agree to be
          bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”), our Privacy Policy, and all
          applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. If you do
          not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Website.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Services Description</h2>
        <p>
          PrimeLocalLead operates as a lead-generation and marketing platform
          that connects consumers seeking local services with independent
          third-party service providers (“Service Providers”). PrimeLocalLead
          does not provide home, professional, or local services directly and
          does not employ, endorse, supervise, or control Service Providers.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          By using the Website, you represent and agree that all information you
          provide is accurate, current, and complete; you are authorized to
          submit the contact information provided; you will use the Website
          only for lawful purposes; and you will not misuse, scrape, disrupt,
          or interfere with the Website or its systems. You are solely
          responsible for any activity conducted using your submitted contact
          details.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Consent to Be Contacted (Important)</h2>
        <p>
          By submitting a form, calling a tracked number, or otherwise providing
          your contact information, you expressly consent to being contacted by
          PrimeLocalLead and/or Service Providers via telephone calls, SMS/text
          messages, and email. These communications may be made using automated
          dialing systems or prerecorded messages, where permitted by law.
          Consent is not a condition of purchase and may be revoked at any time
          by following opt-out instructions or contacting us.
        </p>

        <h2>5. No Guarantees</h2>
        <p>
          PrimeLocalLead makes no representations or warranties regarding the
          accuracy or quality of leads; Service Provider availability or
          responsiveness; pricing, estimates, or quotes; or direct or indirect
          project outcomes or customer satisfaction. All services are provided
          on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Providers</h2>
        <p>
          Service Providers are independent contractors and not agents,
          partners, or employees of PrimeLocalLead. Any agreements, services,
          payments, disputes, warranties, or representations are solely between
          you and the Service Provider. PrimeLocalLead is not responsible for
          the acts, omissions, negligence, licensing, or insurance of any
          Service Provider.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Payments and Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          PrimeLocalLead does not process payments for services performed by
          Service Providers unless expressly stated. Any payment disputes,
          refunds, or chargebacks related to services must be resolved directly
          with the Service Provider.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          All Website content, including but not limited to text, graphics,
          logos, software, and design, is the exclusive property of
          PrimeLocalLead or its licensors and is protected by U.S. and
          international intellectual property laws. Unauthorized use,
          reproduction, or distribution is strictly prohibited.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to use the Website for fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful
          purposes; attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems or data;
          copy, resell, or exploit leads or content without authorization; or
          interfere with Website functionality or security.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, PrimeLocalLead disclaims all
          warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to
          merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
          non-infringement.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, PrimeLocalLead shall not be
          liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or
          punitive damages, including loss of profits, property, data, or
          goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of the Website or any
          services obtained through Service Providers, even if advised of the
          possibility of such damages.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless PrimeLocalLead, its
          owners, officers, affiliates, and employees from any claims,
          liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable
          attorneys’ fees) arising out of your use of the Website; your
          violation of these Terms; or your interactions with any Service
          Provider.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          PrimeLocalLead reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend
          or terminate access to the Website at any time, with or without
          notice, for any reason, including violation of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Governing Law and Venue</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
          laws of the State of Delaware, the state in which Woodpecker Services
          LLC, owner and / or operator of PrimeLocalLead, is organized, without
          regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any legal action shall be
          brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located within
          that state.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p>
          At PrimeLocalLead’s discretion, any dispute arising from these Terms
          or your use of the Website may be resolved through binding arbitration
          on an individual basis. You waive any right to participate in a class
          or representative action.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Severability</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining
          provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
        </p>

        <h2>17. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          PrimeLocalLead may modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of
          the Website after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the
          revised Terms.
